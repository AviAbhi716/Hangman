# Hangman Game

This is a Hangman game implemented in Python, where the player has to guess the name of an Indian city chosen randomly from a predefined list. 

The game follows the traditional Hangman rules:

1. The player is presented with a word represented by underscores (_), where each underscore corresponds to a letter in the city name.
2. The player guesses one letter at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is correct, it replaces the corresponding underscore(s).
4. If the guessed letter is incorrect or has already been guessed, the player loses a life, and the Hangman figure progresses through different stages.
5. The game continues until:
    a. The player correctly guesses all the letters in the word (Winning condition ðŸŽ‰).
    b. The player makes six incorrect guesses, leading to the complete Hangman figure and losing the game (Losing condition ðŸ’€).
   
This game provides an interactive way to test vocabulary and spelling while also adding a fun challenge with limited lives.
